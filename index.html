    <h2>My Background</h2>

    <p class="colorize-on-scroll">
      For almost eight years, I've been on a journey with web development that started in senior high school. My passion
      for
      coding pushed me to learn constantly, even while juggling school and other responsibilities.
      <br>
      <br>
      A significant part of my story involves the hardware I started with. I worked on a laptop with a broken hard drive
      connector and only 2GB of RAM, forcing me to use my phone as a display for my web apps. These limitations became
      my greatest
      teacher. To make progress, I embraced the command line, switched from Windows to <strong>Arch Linux</strong>, and
      became proficient in system optimization.
      <br>
      <br>
      This path honed my skills in creating highly efficient, mobile-first applications and gave me a powerful
      understanding of performance from the ground up. While I love building my own tools with bash scripts, my core
      passion remains creating streamlined, user-friendly web experiences.
